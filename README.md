# Decision Tree Classifier Project
This project involves building and evaluating a Decision Tree Classifier using a dataset. The project is implemented in Google Colab and leverages Python's `scikit-learn` library for the classification tasks.
##  Analysis Process

The analysis process consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**: Building the Decision Tree Classifier using the `scikit-learn` library.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model's parameters to improve its performance.

##  Key Findings

- **Model Performance**: The Decision Tree Classifier's performance was assessed using various evaluation metrics, highlighting its strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Feature Importance**: The importance of each feature in predicting the target variable was analyzed, providing insights into the most significant factors influencing the predictions.
